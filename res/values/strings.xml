        <b>Q: How often is this app\'s data updated?</b> <br/>
        A: If you are connected to the internet, this app pulls all data from the Yugioh Wikia in real time, so the data is always up-to-date. <br/><br/>
        If you are offline, this app uses an offline database, which is updated about once a month. <br/><br/>
